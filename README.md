The Fract-ol project from Rank 02 of 42 School curriculum

Done at Hive Helsinki, with the use of graphics library MLX42 (not MiniLibX)

Mandatory part will let you explore Mandelbrot and Julia fractal sets in two color modes (standard and black&white)

You can zoom in and out (mouse scroll or keys i & o), move the fractal (arrow keys), switch color to B&W (b key) and reset the settings (r key)

Bonus part encompasses one additional fractal (the burning ship) and special color effects (random color set, random and gradual color shifts, as well as rainbow based on linear interpolation)

To compile the project, use `make` or `make bonus` on your terminal
